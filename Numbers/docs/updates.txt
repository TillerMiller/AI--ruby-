--------------
Release Version 1.1

Several changes have been implemented that differentiate
this version of the Numbers Corpus from version 1.0. These
changes include the following:

* Speech files in the /speech directory have been 
  converted from NIST format to RIFF format.

* The directory structure has been modified so that 
  it is more logical and accessible.

* The documentation has been updated so that it 
  accurately reflects the corpus contents.

These and other changes have been made to make the corpus
more useful to the end-user.
