Overview
--------
The Numbers Corpus is a collection of naturally produced
numbers. The utterances were taken from other CSLU
telephone speech data collections, and include isolated
digit strings, continuous digit strings, and
ordinal/cardinal numbers. A total of approximately 15,000
files are included in this corpus.

The utterances in this corpus were taken from other
telephone speech data collections completed at the CSLU. 
In most data collections the callers were asked to leave
their phone number, birthdate, or zipcode at some point.
Also, the callers would occasionally leave numbers in
the midst of another utterance.  The numbers in these
situations were extracted from the host utterance and added
to the Numbers Corpus.

Each file in the Numbers Corpus has an orthographic
Transcription following the CSLU Labeling Conventions.
Also, many of the utterances have been phonetically
labelled.

Release 1.1 of this corpus contains 14999 files.  Of these,
6640 have been phonetically labeled.
